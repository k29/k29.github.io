In the book, "Feynman's lost lecture: The motion of planets around the sun", there is a passage in the book, which goes as follows:
```
Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But he came back a few days later to say, "I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it."
```

In the same fashion these notes are basically an attempt to understand reinforcement learning by reducing it to a freshman level. I am referring to the amazing book, "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, by Barton and Sutton" so far. No plagiarism is intended, all sources I have referred to and shall refer to are given credit here. 
The notes are iterative in nature, like PG metions in one of his essays, "Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out everything unnecessary."

This is a 30 day mini challenge, and shall continue to add a post every day, and hopefully, shall get to a decently good implementation by Day 30. 

All codes shall be linked to my github repo (coming soon)

# Day 1

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning what to do, i.e. map situations to actions and keep doing this again and again, till you can maximise the reward. The agent or the learner does not know what to do in a given situation, but instead learns by doing. It must discoer which action leads to the most reward by trying them. 
The learning agent, must be able to 
1. Sense the state of the environment. 
2. Must be able to take actions that affect the state.
3. Must have a goal relating to the state of the environment.

RL is often considered as a different paradigm of ML, in comparison with supervised and unsupervised learning.
