My name is Kaustubh. I am a tech enthusiast, with interest in algorithms, robotics and machine learning. You can find one of my projects on humanoid robotics [here](http://acyut.com/web/). I did a startup on robotics, [Octoloop Systems](http://octoloop.in), were selected in the interview for YC-W17 batch although couldn't make it. Shut down the startup. Currently working as a developer at Grey Orange, India.
