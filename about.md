My name is Kaustubh. I am a tech enthusiast, with interest in distributed system and robotics. You can find one of my projects on humanoid robotics [here](http://acyut.com/web/). I did a startup on robotics, [Octoloop Systems](http://octoloop.in).
Currently working as a software developer at Amazon building the worlds largest timekeeping systems.
