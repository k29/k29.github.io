This is an overall list of relevant books, I have read so far and I feel are worth reading. I have enjoyed reading others recommendations especially [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), so is just another version of that. 

Books range from what I use at work to learn more about subjects I don't know to biographies, non-fiction and fiction. Feel free to suggest if you think I might like something
